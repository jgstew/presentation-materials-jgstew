## For Windows Root Servers:

Copy `fake_example_win.xml` file to `C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Server\Applications\Config` folder

Wait for fake example plugin to run, which should be quick.

Check MFS log here: `C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Server\Applications\Logs\MFS.log`

Once it has run, check the contents of file `C:\bigfix_example_plugin_output.txt`
